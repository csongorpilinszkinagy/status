# Human Standing Calculator

## Overview
This web application allows users to compare themselves against a diverse, global population dataset. Users can input personal metrics such as age, height, weight, fitness, cognitive skills, and socioeconomic factors, select target or filter criteria, and see **percentile rankings** and **cumulative distribution visualizations** of where they stand.

## Goal
This web application aims to gather individual percentile calculators from different domains — fitness, cognitive skills, health, and socioeconomic measures — and **unite them into a single comprehensive "status" measure**. Users can see how they stand across all aspects of their profile compared to a realistic population dataset, giving a holistic view of their overall standing.

## Features
- **User input**: age, height, weight, and other personal metrics.  
- **Selectable target criteria** and filter buttons.  
- **Percentile calculation** against a realistic population dataset.  
- **Interactive cumulative distribution plots** showing the user’s position.

## Dataset
The mock datasets (~1,000 entries per city) include:

- **Demographics**: age, biological age, gender, height, weight, BMI, bodyfat  
- **Physical Fitness**: VO2Max, sprint and run times, strength measures (bench press, pullups, pushups), flexibility  
- **Cognitive / Skill**: IQ, memory score, reaction time, chess Elo, coding skill  
- **Health / Lifestyle**: sleep hours, resting heart rate, blood pressure, steps per day, smoker status  
- **Socioeconomic**: income, net worth, education years, job level  
- **Location**: city, country, continent  

The data is designed to be realistic and includes weak correlations between variables to reflect general population trends.
